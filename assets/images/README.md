# PWA Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for PWA installation:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels (required)
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels (required)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (optional)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
1. Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
3. Design tools (Figma, Sketch, etc.)

The icons should feature a truck or logistics-related design with the primary color (#2196F3).

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares with the truck emoji/icon.

## Quick Placeholder Creation

You can create simple placeholder icons using ImageMagick or any image editor:
- Create a 192x192 blue square with white text/icon
- Create a 512x512 blue square with white text/icon
